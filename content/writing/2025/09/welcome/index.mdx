# Welcome

Thanks for stopping by this corner of the internet! This is where I share reflections on product development, strategy, and technology.

## What You'll Find Here

I reflect on the intersection of **product**, **strategy**, and **technology**. Topics include:

- Product development best practices
- Strategic thinking and decision-making frameworks
- Technical architecture and engineering
- Lessons learned from building products
- Reflections on the craft of software development

## Why I Reflect

Reflecting helps me:

1. **Clarify my thinking** - Articulating ideas forces me to think more rigorously
2. **Document learnings** - Capturing lessons so I don't forget them
3. **Share knowledge** - Helping others who might benefit from my experiences
4. **Connect with others** - Finding like-minded people and sparking conversations

> **The best code I've written lately? On my phone, while my dog sniffs every tree on the block.**

I never thought I'd be the person who codes on their phone. But [`Claude Code on the web`](https://claude.ai/code) & [`OpenAI Codex`](https://chatgpt.com/codex) changed that — and honestly, it's been a game-changer for how I manage my side projects.

Here's the thing: when you're working on side projects around a family life, you don't get long, uninterrupted blocks of coding time. You get fragments. Fifteen minutes here, half an hour there. Maybe an evening if you're lucky.

The usual approachI would follow would be to divide my open tasks into deep work which I could focus on and then let smaller tasks linger until I could get to it.  These small tasks would pile up until I would be able to dedicate a "real" coding session at my desk. Unfortunately I was finding those small tasks adding up since I struggled to get to them

## Productivity from my Pocket

With `Claude Code` on the web & CODEX, I can knock out tasks from anywhere. And I mean *anywhere*.

Walking the dog? Perfect time to:
- Fix that typo in the README
- Update dependency versions
- Close out those lingering GitHub issues

The magic is that `Claude Code` doesn't just execute commands — it understands context, creates branches, writes the tests, and commits changes following your project conventions. All from my mobile browser.

Here's my typical workflow:

1. **Morning dog walk:** Open `Claude Code` on my phone, pick a small outstanding task from Linear
2. **Let Claude handle it:** It creates a feature branch, makes the changes, runs tests, commits with proper conventions
3. **Back at my desk:** Review the PR, merge if it looks good, make cahnges if needed

The beauty is that Claude handles all the tedious parts — branch naming, commit messages, test setup — while I just provide direction and review the output.

## What Works Best on Mobile

Not every task is mobile-friendly, but what I have seen is that these are perfect:

- **Todo list cleanups** — Closing finished tasks, updating issue statuses
- **Documentation fixes** — Typos, outdated instructions, missing examples
- **Small refactors** — Renaming variables, extracting functions, simplifying logic
- **Test additions** — Adding missing test cases, improving coverage
- **Bug fixes** — Fixing issues with clear deliverables

## The Unexpected Benefit

The real win isn't just productivity but it's **momentum**.

When small tasks don't pile up, your project stays in motion. You come back to your desk with a clean slate and somethign to review instead of a backlog. PRs get reviewed while they're still fresh and so the codebase stays healthy.

And honestly? There's something satisfying about finishing a dog walk with three closed issues and a cleaner codebase.

## Does It Actually Work?

Skeptical? I was too. But after a few weeks of this workflow, I've:

- Closed 40+ minor issues that had been sitting for months
- Kept my test coverage above 90%
- Shipped features faster by breaking them into mobile-friendly chunks
- Actually enjoyed my dog walks more (multitasking guilt-free)

The quality hasn't suffered either. Because I review everything at my desk before merging, I catch any issues while maintaining the speed boost.

To be clear: I'm not writing complex features on my phone. Deep architectural work still needs focused desk time.

But for the maintenance tasks, the small improvements, the "I'll get to it later" items? `Claude Code` on the web turns dead time into productive time.

So next time you're walking the dog, maybe pull out your phone and close a few issues. Your future self (and your project) will thank you.

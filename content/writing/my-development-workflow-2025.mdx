> **From speed to momentum:** how AI reshaped my development workflow in 2025.  

Over the past year, I’ve rebuilt how I work. Between AI coding partners, better tooling, and a bit more structure, I’ve gone from numerous half-finished side projects to shipping working products that actually make sense.  

This post is a look at what my workflow looks like in 2025 — and a peek into how tools like `Claude Code`, `ChatGPT`, and `Linear` fit together, and what I’ve learned about balancing speed and structure (while maintaining my sanity) along the way.

## Slow Start

Over the past two years, I’ve seen how new advances in Artificial Intelligence have unlocked the ability for hobby developers to build and develop tools and solutions at a speed previously unseen. This movement has resulted in a [Cambrian explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion) — a sudden burst of creativity and experimentation where it feels like everyone is building *something* new every week.  

As someone who started their career in engineering and then took a deviation into the world of business and entrepreneurship, I saw tremendous potential in these tools to bring my (admittedly half-baked) ideas to life.  

In my journey through entrepreneurship, I always had a list of business ideas or projects of various scales and viability, bouncing around in my head or hastily jotted down across various notes apps. There was always something blocking their pursuit — capital, time, scalability — but most often it was **development skills**, which I didn’t really have to the extent I needed to get things moving.  

While I could *speak* engineering, when staring at pages of code I’d lose focus quickly and didn’t have much patience for the minutiae needed to deliver something that scales and works. However, if these tools could abstract away some of that complexity, they might reduce the barrier to entry and enable me to build and experiment faster, with lower risks.

## First Steps

After hearing about these tools, I decided to get my hands dirty.  

I initially tried the cohort of “**vibe coding**” apps; a term used for AI-assisted IDEs like [`Cursor`](https://cursor.com), [`Lovable`](https://lovable.dev), and [`Replit`](https://replit.com) that let you code by describing intent rather than syntax. It seemed miraculous to be able to make your ideas come to life and playing with them really heped to stratch the development and building itch I had been feeling. And most of all I was able to build quickly nad I found the **speed** exhilirerating.

However, while I found these tools easy to use, they didn’t really give me confidence that I could build something stable. Things would look correct, but as I kept working on the products, I’d run into issues I couldn’t fix. The black box that my projects were being built in didn't really allow me to see what was happening or even understand why things wree being done in certain ways. My code would eventually devolve into spaghetti and become unmanageable, which really put me off the idea that “vibe-coding” was the answer I looked for.

## New Launches

Those first attempts were messy, but they helped me understand what I actually needed from an AI coding partner.  

This all changed with the launch of [`Claude Code`](https://claude.ai/code).  
All of a sudden, the AI was *in* my codebase, and I could instruct it with a much larger context window directly in my CLI. This was much closer to what I was looking for, and I jumped on it to see how far I could take my projects.  

I loved it. It was concise, capable, and able to solve just about everything I threw at it. The code it produced was modular and manageable, to the extent that even I could understand it.  

More importantly, it gave me **direction**.  
For the first time, my projects felt like connected steps toward a tangible product, and not just random experiments. The gap between my ideas and execution felt smaller, like I finally had some *velocity*.  

Together with `Claude Code`, I built a few hobby projects and deployed real experiments. But with greater speed came a new problem: **managing scope.**

## An Explosion of Features

Once I found a setup that worked, I leaned in, but it turned out I might have leaned on it a bit too hard.  

It was now *incredibly easy* to build new features. Whatever I could think of, I built. If I thought it might add value, I tried it; eventually pushing my codebase into longer and longer solutions.  

Then it would break.  

And I was right back where I started.  
I realized I now had more power, but my scope was exploding since I didn’t have a clear plan. My mindset was *“can it be done?”* not *“should it be done?”* And most importantly I didn’t have a definition of what "success" or “done” meant.  

---

## Bringing Order to the Chaos

I needed to slow down, add some structure, and start defining what “done” actually meant.  

Now that I had a better idea of what I could build, I went back to my idea backlog and started working through it with `Claude Code` to scope things out.  
I focused on answeering key questions such as Could they be built? Did they make sense? Would they take too much effort to maintain and scale?  

Initially, I turned to `Claude` for this, but found that its answers weren’t as inventive as I’d like for brainstorming.  
On advice, I tried out the [`ChatGPT 4.5`](https://chat.openai.com) — and found it to be a better **thought partner** for creative and strategic exercises.  
Together with the newer models from [`OpenAI`](https://openai.com), I could evaluate ideas, break them down into manageable pieces, and define clear scopes of work.  

---

## Adding Structure

Once I knew how to evaluate ideas, the next challenge was managing execution.  

I turned to [`Linear`](https://linear.app) as my project management tool.  
With it, I scoped projects into *epics* and *issues*, set milestones, priorities, estimates, dependencies, and tracked velocity. This helped me understand complexity and how each piece impacted the larger system.  

I started running short sprints to timebox effort and measure output. `Claude Code`’s default five-hour context timeout windows actually worked as perfect sprint bursts — long enough to make progress, short enough to stay sharp.  

To manage feature development, I moved to **Git- and TDD-based development**.  
I instructed `Claude Code` or [`OpenAI Codex`](https://chatgpt.com/codex) to write tests before code. Each change lived in a new branch, and I submitted work as pull requests for review in [`GitHub`](https://github.com).  

This prevented errors from spreading through the codebase and kept context clean where each issue or branch started fresh, free from old noise.

> ## What I've Learned About Working With AI as a coding partner
>
> Working with AI as a coding partner has been incredibly enlightening. I've learned that:
>
> **Scope management** matters more than ever. As the barriers to build come down, it's even more important to stay focused on the end goal.
>
> **Context is a currency.** Keeping sessions small and focused makes AI output exponentially better.
>
> **Burnout hides in productivity.** Just because I *can* build faster doesn't mean I *should* keep going nonstop.
>
> The most valuable thing AI gives me isn't speed; it's *momentum*.
>
> Momentum is mass times velocity — *speed with direction*. And that direction is what turns raw motion into real progress.

# 🏁 Wrapping Up

So this is where I am now — juggling between bursts of writing code, reviewing pull requests, scoping future work, and childcare sandwiched in between.  
And it works for me.  

What’s next?  
Playing around more with `Claude Code` and `Codex` on the web, exploring Claude Skills, and continuing to build and ship — this time with a clearer sense of **direction** and enough structure to keep the **momentum** going.

Once I started layering in structure, I noticed something new:  
I could now go after **larger projects** without losing control.  
Structure gave my work more *mass* — weight and stability — which meant I could tackle bigger systems or juggle multiple projects concurrently without things collapsing under their own speed.  

That’s when momentum truly took shape — not just motion, but motion with **direction and weight**.

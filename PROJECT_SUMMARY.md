   - Copy epic descriptions and create in Linear
   - Copy issue descriptions and create in Linear
   - Apply priority labels (P0-P4)
   - Add dependencies using Linear's dependency feature

3. **Read Project Documentation**
   - Review [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) to understand:
     - TDD workflow (write tests first!)
     - Git branching strategy
     - Data architecture
     - Development commands

### First Development Tasks (P0 - Critical)

Once Linear is updated, start with these issues in order:

## 🔄 Git Workflow Reminder

```bash
# Start from development branch
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/epic-1-next-setup

# Write tests first (TDD)
# Implement feature
# Commit with conventional commits

git add .
git commit -m "feat(foundation): initialize Next.js with Tailwind"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/epic-1-next-setup
# Create PR: feature/epic-1-next-setup → development
```

## 📝 Key Decisions Made

### Design & UX
- ✅ 3 unique color palettes created (choose one)
- ✅ No dark/light mode toggle (removed)
- ✅ Warm, modern, professional aesthetic
- ✅ Focus on standing out and being unique

### Testing Strategy
- ✅ **Strict TDD:** Write tests first, always
- ✅ Test every component
- ✅ Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- ✅ Tests run on every push (informational, not blocking)

### DevOps & Deployment
- ✅ `main` → production (colinrodrigues.com)
- ✅ `development` → staging (dev.colinrodrigues.com)
- ✅ Feature branches → preview (dev.colinrodrigues.com)
- ✅ 1 PR approver required
